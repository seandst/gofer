Installation
============

Packages
^^^^^^^^

Gofer is packaged into RPMs for Linux.  These packages are as follows:

- **gofer** - The gofer agent (goferd).
- **python-gofer** - The common library.
- **python-gofer-qpid** - The python-qpid messaging adapter.
- **python-gofer-amqp** - The python-amqp messaging adapter.

Depending on system capabilities, the *gofer* package registers goferd
with systemd or upstart service managers.

python optimizations
--------------------
By default, gofer runs python with optimizations enabled. If you want to disable those
optimizations, this can be done by altering the environment file for this service,
``/etc/sysconfig/goferd``, and setting the value of PYTHONOPTIMZE to zero
(``PYTHONOPTIMIZE=0``).

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^

The gofer project is hosted by Github.  To install from source, you must first clone the
git repository.  The python library can be installed using something like pip.  Once installed,
the goferd daemon can be installed.

Cloning the repository::
